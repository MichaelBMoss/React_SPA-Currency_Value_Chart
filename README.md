# Currency Value Chart

    I created this application to build and demonstrate my skills working with APIs, the React framework and CSS.

    This app displays a bar chart representing the amounts of some common world currencies that are equal in value to one US dollar.

    The Chart can display between 1 and 5 currencies and the bar sizes adjust relative to the other currencies chosen.  Please hover over an individual bar to see that currency's data.

    CSS transitions are used to create a pleasantly dynamic chart.

    Data is retrieved from the Exchange Rates Data Api provided by apilayer.com.

    This application was created using React, Javascript, Css, and HTML.
